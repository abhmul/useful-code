# useful-code

This repository collects together useful template code that I end up needing to use often. I used to have a [projects-repo](https://github.com/abhmul/projects-repo), but it was too complicated to maintain an actual library of code made up of hodgepodge code. I often ended up needing to copy the code anyways because the projects I was working on needed to use a very basic set of package dependencies to aid with reproducibility.

So instead these are mostly just code snippets I try to keep general.
